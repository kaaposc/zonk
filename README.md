 * There are 10 legs
 * In each throw you must keep 1 or more dice
 * Going to next leg (save) allowed only after at least 300 pts are kept
 * Empty throw is Zonk!
 * Three Zonk!s in a row gives a penalty -1000 pts
 * After all dice are kept, sum is memorized and all dice are throwable again (leg stays current)
